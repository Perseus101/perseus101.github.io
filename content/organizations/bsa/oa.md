I have been a proud member of Boy Scouting's National Honor Society, the Order of the Arrow, since 2011.
In 2016, I had the honor of being elected as [Occoneechee Lodge 104's](https://lodge104.net/) Vice Chief of Program.
During my term, I had the opportunity to work with and learn from a great number of very passionate people,
and lead them in service to our community.
