In the Aerial Robotics Club, I work with the software team to maintain the systems of the plane and ground station.
These include the [Pixhawk autopilot](https://pixhawk.org/), our telemetry server, the flight database, the imagery system,
and the manual and [autonomous](https://github.com/ncsuarc/ARC_Vision) target detection systems.
