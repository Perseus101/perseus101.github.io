title: "About Me"
---

Hi I am Colin Moore, a PhD student at North Carolina State University working under Dr. John-Paul Ore in the [RobotCodeLab](https://robotcodelab.com/). My primary research interest are in Sim2Real and Reinforcement Learning. These research fields involve training robots in simulations and then transferring this learned behavior to real-world tasks.

With a strong background in computer science and engineering, I'm focused on expanding our understanding of these areas. My work is about helping robots to learn from their own actions and adjust their behavior based on these learnings.

This website is a place where I share my research, academic papers, and projects. If you're a researcher, interested in technology, or just browsing, I hope you find something useful or interesting here.

Please feel free to take a look around. I'm always open to questions or possible collaborations. Every interaction is a chance to learn something new. Thanks for stopping by!
