ADLC
----

The `ADLC <https://github.com/ncsuarc/ARC_Vision>`_ project, or Automatic Detection, Localization, and Classification,
was a project I took on for the club starting in 2016.
This system loads images taken by the aircraft during flight and processes them,
then identifies targets on the ground.
The project is written entirely in Python. It uses OpenCV to process the images initially to find likely regions of interest.
Those regions of interest are then fed through a series of neural networks created using Tensorflow
to remove false positives and then identify features about the target.
