Snake3D
-------

Snake3D was a group project I worked on for a class. The project was created
using `WebGL <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API>`_
and `glMatrix <http://glmatrix.net/>`_.

After the project was finished, I converted the website to add support for some
mobile devices, and published it online `here <https://www.moore.one/Snake3D/>`_.
