Check out my `Github page <https://github.com/Perseus101>`_ to see some of my projects!

RustDAG
-------

Although this project is nowhere near finished(the name isn't even final!),
it's been my main project recently, so I'm excited to talk about it.

RustDAG is a distributed ledger technology(DLT) written in `Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/>`_.
It uses a Merkle DAG to track transactions as they occur, executes Smart Contracts in WebAssembly(WASM)
and uses a `Merkle Patricia Tree <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Patricia-Tree>`_
to track the internal state of Smart Contracts. You can see the code `here <https://github.com/Perseus101/RustDAG>`_.


Snake3D
-------

Snake3D was a group project I worked on for CSC561, Introduction to Computer Graphics.
The project was created using `WebGL <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API>`_
and `glMatrix <http://glmatrix.net/>`_. I want to give special thanks to my group members,
`Johnny Rocket <https://johnnyrockett.dev/>`_, `Stuart Hunt <https://stuarthunt.dev/>`_,
and `Jazmine Wang <https://jasminewang0.github.io/>`_, for making this project a blast to create!

After the project was finished, I converted the website to add support for some
mobile devices, and `published it online here <https://www.moore.one/Snake3D/>`_.
